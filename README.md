This mod changes the functionality of each weapon adding 3 stats that are randomly rolled to be modified. 

Each weapon can now be dropped by enemies with these random stats. 

By pressing "x" you can drop your weapon allowing you to pick up a new weapon of that slot!

Killing enemies also drops you points that can be spent in the menu to allow you to randomly generate a weapon.

Here are the weapons' changes:
Rocket - mag size, projectile speed, num projectiles	//bugged so it only deals 1 dmg and only to the player idk why
Blaster - spread, num projectiles, charge time
Shotgun - mag size, damage, spread
Dark Matter - spread, num projectiles, fire rate
Grenade Launcher - clip size, num projectile, fuse time ,+ spread for clarity
Hyperblaster - dmg, mag size, fire rate
Lightning - dmg, ammo cost per shot
Machine Gun - mag size Large, spread, dmg
Nail Gun - large mag, dmg, spread, num attacks
Napalm Gun - projectile's gravity, splash dmg

Railgun - dmg, mag size, //this gun does not want to be edited crashes the game consistently even on just changing the mag size; Gonna skip
